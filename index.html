					Compiled and taught "Argentine Writers of the 20th Century", a poetry class focused on deeply influential writers of the nation's literary scene. Introduced and contextualized Argentine poets within the socio-political situation of the country, while presenting media material such as recorded readings, live performances and slide presentations with historical references and biographical material. Facilitated "How to Read and Discuss Poetry". For the upcoming session of Fall Season of 2015, I submitted a proposal for "A Brief History of Pessimism", a class intended to serve as a biopsy of pessimism as a Philosophy, tracing its precursors in ancient civilizations and influences in modern pop culture.</p>
